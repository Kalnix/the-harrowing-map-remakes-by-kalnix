My FOTRP map remakes for Pathfinder 2nd Edition

This is a map remake of the Pathfinder 1st edition adventure The Harrowing created by Paizo. This does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventure path. You can buy the PDF here https://paizo.com/products/btpy8lv9?Pathfinder-Module-The-Harrowing 

I have taken some artistic liberty with some of the maps in the book as I did not have a great way to recreate some of them in DungeonDraft. There are also a couple of additional maps.

Maps are usually 150x150 pixels.
